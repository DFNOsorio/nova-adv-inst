# Lab 6 - Logging and plotting

## Lab Goals

Save data in a file 

## Goal 1 - Write to a file

* During 10 seconds write to a file the value at A0 at a frequency of one sample per second
* Use a format of time [tab] sample per line

## Goal 2 - Find maximum sample rate

Test with different sampling rates and verify when the samples start to delay.

## Goal 3 - Plot the logged data

Create a plot of the last 20 seconds

## Goal 4 - Update the plot from 10 to 10 seconds

Use two processes one for the writing and the other to plot.
Recreate the plot after a pause of 10 seconds by reading the file again. If needed (for higher sampling rates) do subsampling.

# Lab 1 - Setting up Arduino


## Starting steps

* Install arduino IDE at  https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software
* Connect via USB cable (A-B usb cable) to your laptop
* Test connection


## Lab Goals

## Goal 1 - Blinking Led
* Run the code on the ide to run the blinkng code: BLINK.

** learn the following functions
> pinMode
> digitalWrite

## Goal 2 - Measuring 

* Read a value function with from an analog entry: ANALOGREAD. 
* Validate the reading using the multimeter. 


** learn the following functions
> analogRead


## Goal 3 - Deciding on threshold

* Combine the previous two goals on a threshold detector
* Read an analog input and if higher than 3V turn on the led.
* Attention the amplitude should be lower than 5v (TO CHECK)

## Goal 3
* Activate the PWM with a 1kHz function and to dim the led light. 
* Use the code example
* Verify on the osciloscope the PWM frequency and the width of the square wave.
